*"A Zettelkasten is a personal tool for thinking and writing. It has hypertextual features to make a web of thought possible. The difference to other systems is that you create a web of thoughts instead of notes of arbitrary size and form, and emphasize connection, not a collection."*

[Introduction to the Zettelkasten Method â€¢ Zettelkasten Method](https://zettelkasten.de/introduction/)

## Notes
- I believe this works well with a tool like [[Obsidian]] and are willing to give it a go to better #structuring-notes. I do how ever need to invest the time to understand it a little better. Perhaps i can devote around 20 hours to this.


## Key takeaways

- A [[Zettle]] is a relatively short piece of paper, a "thought", it has 3 parts to it
	- id - a unique id so it is possible to change names without affecting links
	- body - the thought itself
	- reference - references to the source of knowledge, empty if your own thought
- use your current projects as golden threads to guide your work while allowing a bit of deviation from this  (byproducts)
- byproducts are not waste. In the long run, they become valuable knowledge for your future projects
