*"A Zettelkasten is a personal tool for thinking and writing. It has hypertextual features to make a web of thought possible. The difference to other systems is that you create a web of thoughts instead of notes of arbitrary size and form, and emphasize connection, not a collection."*

## Notes
- I believe this works well with a tool like [[Obsidian]] and are willing to give it a go to better #structuring-notes. I do how ever need to invest the time to understand it a little better. Perhaps i can devote around 20 hours to this.
