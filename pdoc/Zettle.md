#### About 
A settle is a paper note, a thought or idea (ref [[Zettlekasten]]). 
Its supposed to be atomic (short for one zettle = one idea), and link and reference other thoughts.

Each zettle has three parts
- id - a unique id for the vault
- body - the contents of the thought, written in your own words
- reference - the source of knowledge you reference

To automate this i have created a Zettle_template_v1.
The id is the name of the article. 
The metadata is provided by the plugin templater and looks like this.

status: [[status]]
topic: [[topic]]

`creation date` and `modification date` so it is easy to see the article age and when it was last reviewed/modified.
`status` is to indicate how mature/developed the article is.
`topic` is a keyword to relate zettle's together when/if the [[PARA]] method breaks.


Weaknesses for id: conflicting article names, or slightly different words for the same thing can clutter your vault. 
To mitigate this you need to manage your topics carefully.
