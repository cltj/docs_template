#structuring-notes 

[Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) is a tool for #structuring-notes and information. It has gained popularity in the IT space cause of its simple use, eco-system of plugins and customization options. 

Together with [[PARA]] and [[Zettlekasten]] methods i aim to get valuable information quickly

### Structure
Obsidian dialect of markdown is used for text, it has directories and a special `.obsidian` directory that holds the configurations settings. 


### Obsidian Plugins
- git - lets you interact with git straight from within obsidian
- version history diff - displays the Source control tab

### Questions and ideas
- Is it enough to just symlink to my `/icloudstorage/douments/docs/pdoc` from my linux home directly? How does this work when i get better at neovim and with telescope?
- Can i independently develop my `.obsidian` directory as a part of a docs_template in git? Is it useful? 


> [!NOTES]
> What does a useful template look like to me. 
> Read more about zettlekasten and PARA first. 
> Experiment with tags and links and templates
