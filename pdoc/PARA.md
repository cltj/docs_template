PARA is a way of #structuring-notes

I am willing to give this a try. 
For a theoretical understanding refer to [The PARA Method: The Simple System for Organizing Your Digital Life in Seconds](https://fortelabs.com/blog/para/)

PARA consist of 4 categories:
You have **projects** you’re actively working on – short-term efforts (in your work or personal life) that you take on with a certain goal in mind. For example:

- Learn terraform
- Buy a macbook pro
- Lawncare
- Make dotfiles work
- Become more proficient with neovim
- Lose weight

You have **areas** of responsibility – important parts of your work and life that require ongoing attention (it will never end) . These might include:

- Work responsibilities such as Platform Engineering, Python Development, Startup
- Personal responsibilities such as Health, Finances, Car, Husbanding, Gardening and Home

Then you have **resources** on a range of topics you’re interested in and learning about, such as:

- Terraform, neovim, python, linux, git/dithub/devops
- Personal productivity
- Organic gardening
- Neovim
- Lawncare
- Garden design
- Woodworking
- Notetaking

Finally, you have **archives**, which include anything from the previous three categories that is no longer active, but you might want to save for future reference:

- Projects you’ve completed or put on hold
- Areas that are no longer active or relevant
- Resources that you’re no longer interested in


> [!NOTE]
> And that’s it! Four top-level folders – `Projects, Areas, Resources, and Archives` – each containing a small number of subfolders dedicated to each active project, area of responsibility, resource, and archive in your life.
> 
> In addition i have added a `Template` directory for obsidian templates as well as a `Attachment` directory for storing images and documents.

Combining PARA and [[Zettlekasten]] with a tool like [[Obsidian]] I hope to quickly get to useful info, sourced from the web or remembering my own thoughts and advancements.
