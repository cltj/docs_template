# Index

Welcome to your new documentation vault! This is the main index where you can find links to all the important sections of your documentation.

This documentation tries to follow the [zettelkasten](https://zettelkasten.de/introduction/) approach, using the [PARA](https://fortelabs.com/blog/para/) method. 
## Sections

- [Projects](Projects/)
- [Areas](Areas/)
- [Resources](Resources/)
- [Archive](/Archive)

In addition there is Attachments for screenshots (give images meaningful names), and a Templates part that can be improved over time. 
- [Attachments](Attachments/)
- [Templates](Templates/)

## Getting Started

To get started with this vault, check out the [Quickstart Guide](Quickstart.md) and the [Welcome Note](Welcome.md).

That said, feel free to customize this index to fit your documentation needs.
