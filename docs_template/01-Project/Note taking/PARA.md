Summary: PARA is a simple way of structuring notes. It is based on the observation: "that there are only four categories that encompass all the information in your life".
- **projects** - short term efforts you are actively working on (usually have a completion date)
- **area** - ongoing parts of life that require attention
- **resource** - topics you are interested in learning
- **archive** - unactive parts from the above that you want kept

---
#### Key takeaways
PARA promises a simple, comprehensive, yet extremely flexible system for organizing any type of digital information.
It is a minimalistic way to addÂ _just enough_Â order to your environment that you have the clarity to move forward.

**Its focus is by submitting and (re)using and manageing information in a quick manner you over time improve your productivity**

#### Body
PARA consist of 4 categories:
You haveÂ **projects**Â youâ€™re actively working on â€“ short-term efforts (in your work or personal life) that you take on with a certain goal in mind. For example:

- Learn terraform
- Buy a macbook pro
- Lawncare
- Make dotfiles work
- Become more proficient with neovim
- Lose weight

You haveÂ **areas**Â of responsibility â€“ important parts of your work and life that require ongoing attention (it will never end) . These might include:

- Work responsibilities such as Platform Engineering, Python Development, Startup
- Personal responsibilities such as Health, Finances, Car, Husbanding, Gardening and Home

Then you haveÂ **resources**Â on a range of topics youâ€™re interested in and learning about, such as:

- Terraform, neovim, python, linux, git/dithub/devops
- Personal productivity
- Organic gardening
- Neovim
- Lawncare
- Garden design
- Woodworking
- Notetaking

Finally, you haveÂ **archives**, which include anything from the previous three categories that is no longer active, but you might want to save for future reference:

- Projects youâ€™ve completed or put on hold
- Areas that are no longer active or relevant
- Resources that youâ€™re no longer interested in


> [!NOTE]
> And thatâ€™s it! Four top-level foldersÂ â€“ `Projects, Areas, Resources, and Archives` â€“ each containing a small number of subfolders dedicated to each active project, area of responsibility, resource, and archive in your life.
> 
> In addition i have added a `Template` directory for obsidian templates as well as a `Attachment` directory for storing images and documents.

Combining PARA and [[Zettlekasten]] with a tool like [[Obsidian]] I hope to quickly get to useful info, sourced from the web or remembering my own thoughts and advancements.
