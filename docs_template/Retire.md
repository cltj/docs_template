Summary:

#### Mission
- I want to be financially independent by the time i am 45 year old. 
- It does not necessarily follow that I wont work after 45, but it frees me up to choose my engagements and level of involvement. 
#### Method
I believe that building a strong foundation is key to safely arrive at a predictable retirement. 
This is why i will follow a waterfall approach. Waterfall does a couple of things. 
- It focus on increasing risky assets, starting with the least risk.
- It is a real feeling of achievement to see progress month by month
- It is a slow, but steady way to complete the mission
